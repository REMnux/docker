One aspect of the REMnux project involves providing [Docker images of popular malware analysis tools](https://remnux.org/docs/containers/malware-analysis/), with the goal of allowing investigators to conveniently utilize difficult-to-install applications without having to install the REMnux distro. You and download and run existing images and contribute your own to the REMnux collection.
