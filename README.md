One aspect of the REMnux project involves providing [Docker images of popular malware analysis tools](https://docs.remnux.org/#run-in-containers), with the goal of allowing investigators to conveniently utilize difficult-to-install applications without having to install the REMnux distro. You can [download and run existing images](https://docs.remnux.org/run-tools-in-containers/remnux-containers) and [contribute your own](https://docs.remnux.org/get-involved/add-or-update-tools/contribute-dockerfile) to the REMnux collection. You can also [run the REMnux distro as a Docker container](https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/remnux-as-a-container) by using the prebuilt Docker image hosted in the REMNux repository on Docker Hub.

This Github repository hosts the Dockerfiles themselves. The resulting images are built and hosted at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/remnux/).
