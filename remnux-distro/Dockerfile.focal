# This Docker image encapsulates the REMnux v7 distro on Ubuntu 20.04 (focal).
# For details about REMnux, including how you can run it on a physical system
# or as a virtual machine, see https://REMnux.org.
#
# You can run this image as a container using a command such as:
#
# docker run --rm -it remnux/remnux-distro /bin/bash
#
# To map a local directory into the container's /home/remnux/files directory,
# you could use a command lile this by supplying the appropriate directory name:
#
# docker run --rm -it -v <local_directory>:/home/remnux/files remnux/remnux-distro /bin/bash
#
# If you'd like to access the container using SSH,  you can invoke it like this by
# mapping your local TCP port 22 to the container's internal TCP port 22. In this example,
# the container will remain active in the background:
#
# docker run -d -p 22:22 remnux/remnux-distro
#
# If you're going to run this container in a remote cloud, be sure to change the default
# password and otherwise harden the system according to your requirements.
#
# If you're planning to use Cutter inside the container, you'll need to include the
# --privileged parameter when invoking Docker.
